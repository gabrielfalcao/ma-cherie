Overview
========

Ma Chérie aims to be a simple web-based picture viewer in Python.
Is powered by CherryPy and has an simple filesystem-based engine.

Why "Ma Chérie"
===============

It is a two-hit combo naming:
* The project is based in [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/ "CherryPy"), "Chérie" resembles it.
* Means "My Dear Woman", and I made it to publish some personal pictures to my girl to see.
