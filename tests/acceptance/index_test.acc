As a Ma Cherie user
I want to see all images listed on my server
So that I can navigate over them

Scenario 1 - See if the title is the expected
    Given
        I go to "/"
    When
        I wait for the page to load
    Then
        I see "Ma Cherie" title

Scenario 2 - See that all test images are being listed
    Given
        I go to "/"
    When
        I wait for the page to load
    Then
        I see "bat_boy.jpg" image
        And I see "clown.jpg" image
        And I see "girl.jpg" image
        And I see "girl_face.jpg" image
        And I see "man_portrait.jpg" image
        And I see "painted_man.jpg" image
        And I see "skate_boarder.jpg" image
        And I see "surfist.jpg" image

Scenario 3 - Show image in lightbox
    Given
        I go to "/"
        And I wait for the page to load
    When
        I see "clown.jpg" image
        And I click "clown.jpg-link" link
    Then
        I wait for "lightbox-container-image-box" div to be present

Scenario 4 - Search textbox gets empty when focused
    Given
        I go to "/"
        And I see "search" textbox
        And I see "search" textbox contains "Search"
    When
        I click "search" textbox
    Then
        And I see "search" textbox is empty

Scenario 5 - Test search will filter images
    Given
        I go to "/"
    When
        I fill "search" textbox with "girl"
        And I click "do-search" button and wait
    Then
        I see "girl.jpg" image
        And I see "girl_face.jpg" image
        And I do not see "bat_boy.jpg" image
