Overview
========

Ma Chérie aims to be a simple web-based picture viewer in Python.
Is powered by CherryPy and has an simple filesystem-based engine.
No database is used.

Why "Ma Chérie"
===============

It is a two-hit combo naming:
 * The project is based in CherryPy, "Chérie" resembles it.
 * Means "My Dear Women", and I made it to publish some
   personal pictures to my girl to see.
